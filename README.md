Overview: Write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.

Process:
1. Create a Hat class with variable number of arguments
2. Convert arguments to a contents instance variable (a list of strings)
3. Create draw method for Hat
4. Create experiment function

What I've learned:
1. How to write functions with variable number of arguments; more specifically with keyword arguments; also how to force keyword arguments
2. Iterating through dictionaries by using .items() and transforming them to tuples
3. Using the range() function to iterate a specified number of times
4. How to use the random module; specifically random.choice() to choose a random element in a list
5. How to remove elements from a list
6. Understanding the difference between shallow and deep copies (for lists)
7. How to populate a dictionary with get() to create a key-count
8. How to debug by working through code step by step and analyzing the problem
9. How to respond to unit tests and fix the code appropriatly
